- 👀 I’m interested in tinkering with code, in various languages and environments (shell script, perl, JavaScript)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic JavaScript and brushing up on my Perl skills from decades ago
- 💞️ I’m not really interested in collaborating here right now. This is my sandbox for various research efforts.
- 📫 How to reach me - if you know me, I'm not hard to find.
